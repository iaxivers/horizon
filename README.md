# Horizon

Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3, rewritten in Rust. Same worlds, same rules, same terrain, checked against the Java game by more than 300 differential harnesses. Free, open source and unofficial.

> Not an official Minecraft product, nor approved by or associated with Mojang or Microsoft. Horizon contains no Minecraft code, assets or data: you need your own copy of Java Edition 26.3.

## This fork: Fabric mods in Horizon

> **Branch `java-bridge`** of [iaxivers/horizon](https://github.com/iaxivers/horizon). Work in progress, not part of upstream Horizon yet.

The Java bridge runs **real Fabric mods for 26.3** inside Horizon. **Horizon's world stays the real one:** Horizon (Rust) keeps running all of vanilla's logic (terrain, blocks, redstone, mobs, physics, the server, saving, rendering). A Java VM in the game's own process loads Fabric Loader and the real 26.3 jar and runs **only the mods' own code** (their mobs, machines, worldgen features, screens) against a mirror of Horizon's world, made lazily as mods read it; what the mods change is written back into Horizon's world. Without mod jars, Java never starts. The goal is big packs, SkyFactory-style, at Horizon's speed.

**Status (2026-11-03):** an 81-jar pack (165 mods with the ones they bundle) plays on a real PC (RX 9070 XT, Fedora), from the launcher, at about the same speed as Horizon without mods. Not released yet: build it yourself (below).

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Loading | ✅ 81- to 107-jar packs start (up to 265 mods, 20,000+ recipes); content made once per set of jars, Java's classes cached between runs |
| Blocks, items, recipes, creative tabs | ✅ (🐛 some mod blocks invisible when placed until a relaunch; a few missing textures) |
| Machines and their screens (block entities, menus) | ✅ Farmer's Delight, Tom's Storage, Energized Power, CC: Tweaked, XNet, BuildCraft (🐛 hoppers in a pack with Lithium) |
| REI, Jade, AppleSkin, tooltips, skill trees | ✅ REI's list, search, R/U and recipes; Legendary Tooltips; Pufferfish's Skills; Advanced Loot Info |
| Maps | ✅ Xaero's Minimap and World Map, XaeroPlus, JourneyMap, VoxelMap (not beside Xaero's: both register the same packet), MiniHUD |
| Mod mobs: AI, combat, models, saving, sounds, particles, projectiles | ✅ Naturalist, Friends & Foes, Mutant Monsters, GeckoLib mobs; they fight Horizon's mobs and players both ways |
| Mod worldgen: biomes, structures, colours, `/locate`, far terrain | ✅ Overworld, Nether, End; Biomes O' Plenty, Towns and Towers, Dungeons and Taverns; Tectonic's far terrain; skyblock and one-block worlds |
| Mixins that change vanilla behaviour | ✅ Veinminer, Right Click Harvest, Carry On, Serene Seasons, Clumps, Better Combat: what a mod patches (breaking, using, hitting, jumps, teleports, falls, effects, advancements) goes to Java |
| Multiplayer with mods | ✅ LAN and dedicated servers: each player's own maps, REI and mod settings |
| The launcher | ✅ a **Java mods** tab (add, remove, which mods failed last game); runs from a normal install, fetches Java 25 itself |
| Renderer replacements (Sodium, Iris) | ➖ not needed: Horizon has its own renderer, so they have nothing to replace |
| Mods that draw in the world (Litematica's overlay) | 🚧 |
| Windows | ✅ builds and plays on Windows 11; no published build yet |

**Beta testers: start with [Try it](#try-it) and the [testers' guide](docs/java-bridge-beta.md).** How it works, the tick flow, 26.3 traps and the test tools: **[docs/java-bridge.md](docs/java-bridge.md)**.

### Try it

**New here? Follow the [simple step-by-step version](human-java-bridge.md).**

**Easiest: press Play in Prism Launcher.** On Windows or Linux (macOS is untested), with Rust, Git and a JDK 25 installed:

```sh
git clone -b java-bridge https://github.com/iaxivers/horizon && cd horizon
cargo run --profile fast -p horizon-play    # builds the game once; quit it when it opens
```

Then in [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org):

1. Make a Minecraft **26.3** + **Fabric** instance and add a mod.
2. Right-click it > **Edit** > **Settings** > tick **Custom commands**.
3. Paste the full path of `target/fast/horizon-play` (`horizon-play.exe` on Windows) into **Wrapper command**, and close the window.
4. Press **Play**. The first start takes a few minutes.

To go back to normal Minecraft, untick **Custom commands**. The **[testers' guide](docs/java-bridge-beta.md)** has every step, other ways to play, and what to test.

**From the launcher:** build it (`cd launcher && cargo build --release`; Fedora needs `libxkbcommon-x11-devel`), install your game build as a version with `horizon-launcher import-build target/fast/horizon-client --trust-unsigned`, add jars with `horizon-launcher java-mods add <jar>`, then the **Java mods** tab shows on Home. Start it with `HORIZON_LAUNCHER_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1` so it doesn't update itself to upstream's.

**Tests:** `python3 tools/java_bridge/regress.py --jars <jars>` plays every scene that once worked, headless, with screenshots; `--pack <mods folder> bigpack` plays a whole pack. Add `HORIZON_JAVA_PROFILE=1` to see what the mods cost each tick.

## Download

Get **the Horizon launcher** from [playhorizon.dev](https://playhorizon.dev) or [the launcher releases](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/releases?q=launcher-v&expanded=true) (Linux x86-64, macOS on Apple Silicon, macOS on Intel from the next Nightly, Windows x64). It installs and updates the game, prepares its files from your copy of Minecraft, and updates itself.

**You need** a Microsoft account that owns Java Edition ([why](docs/microsoft-account.md)) and a GPU with Vulkan or OpenGL 3.3 (Linux), Vulkan or DirectX 12 (Windows), or a Mac (Apple Silicon, or Intel from the next Nightly). An existing Minecraft install (official launcher, Prism, MultiMC...) is reused; without one, Play downloads 26.3 from Mojang for your account. Step by step: [Install and first launch](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/install).

## What works today

- **The game:** vanilla world generation, mobs, villagers, raids, redstone, every command, the HUD and the recipe book, on vanilla saves. Worlds from 1.8 to 26.2 are upgraded. [Status](#project-status).
- **Extras:** new menus, graphics presets, distant terrain up to 1024 chunks, controllers, zoom, minimap and more, off by default where they change the vanilla look. [Settings](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/settings).
- **Packs:** resource packs, and data packs with functions, predicates, item modifiers and world generation.
- **Multiplayer:** invite friends with a code, Open to LAN, join servers (online mode included). [Multiplayer](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/multiplayer).
- **Mods:** content mods (blocks, items, data) and native Rust mods, built by the launcher with nothing to install. Java mod jars do not run. [Mods](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/mods).

In the Rust client, with vanilla assets and no mods or shaders:

</table>

## Host a server

The launcher's **Servers** page creates, starts, backs up and updates a server, and invites friends over Tailscale. On a VPS, `horizon-server` installs with one command and needs no Java. [Host a server](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/hosting) ([reference](docs/hosting.md)).

## Modpacks

The launcher imports Modrinth and CurseForge packs and plays the mods Horizon can carry over: today, content mods made of data and assets, not Java code. [Modpacks](https://playhorizon.dev/docs/modpacks).

## Agent control

AI agents and scripts can play Horizon. `horizon-ctl`, shipped with the game, reads its state as JSON and acts like a player; `horizon-ctl mcp` serves the same commands over MCP.

```sh
horizon-ctl launch --world Survival --seed 5 --wait   # finds the version the launcher installed
horizon-ctl state                                       # position, health, food, target, screen...
horizon-ctl find-block birch_log                        # the nearest logs
horizon-ctl goto -0.5 65 -2.5 --near 2.5                # walks there along a path
horizon-ctl break -1 65 -3                              # mines it; replies with the drops
horizon-ctl open-inventory && horizon-ctl click-slot 0  # menus: slots, buttons by label, text fields
```

Commands block until done and reply with the result; `horizon-ctl help` lists them all. [Agent control](docs/native-client.md#agent-control-horizon-ctl-and-mcp).

## Build from source

Needs Rust 1.90+, Python 3.10+, JDK 25, and on Linux `libasound2-dev libudev-dev`. `horizon-prepare` builds the game's resources from **your own copy** of Java Edition 26.3 (checked against `research-lock.json`) and never downloads it:

1. **Client:** play 26.3 once in the official launcher. Horizon reads `~/.minecraft` (or `--minecraft-dir` / `HORIZON_MINECRAFT_DIR`).
2. **Server jar:** the 26.3 server jar (`downloads.server.url` in `versions/26.3/26.3.json`), passed once with `--server-jar` or `HORIZON_SERVER_JAR`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon.git
cd horizon
cargo run --release -p horizon-prepare -- --prepare --server-jar ~/Downloads/server.jar   # needs JDK 25
cargo run --release -p horizon-prepare -- sounds   # optional: sounds from your launcher install
cargo run --release -p horizon-client
```

Prepared files land in the gitignored `.local/`: never commit or share them. Options, controls and architecture: [the native client guide](docs/native-client.md); all developer docs: [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## Roadmap

What is in progress, what comes next and where to help: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), or [playhorizon.dev/hub](https://playhorizon.dev/hub) with the work board and what shipped.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome: read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (vanilla first, small pull requests). Questions: [Discord](https://discord.gg/playhorizon). Before a pull request, run the self-check and paste its output:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
python3 tools/pr_ready.py
```

It runs rustfmt, clippy, the touched crates' tests, the Python tests, the public-tree check and the vanilla harnesses your change affects. Never commit game files, decompiled source or prepared resources.

## Project status

**Player-visible gaps: 833 open** of the 833 the [port ledger](tools/port_ledger.py) found, reading every vanilla 26.3 method against Horizon's code: vanilla behaviour a player would notice that Horizon doesn't have yet. By area: Screens, HUD and client packets [197](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3518); Entity and block rendering, models [129](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3519); Animals [110](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3512); Server and players on the server [106](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3520); Blocks, redstone and fluids [86](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3516); Entities, projectiles, vehicles and decorations [64](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3514); Monsters and bosses [53](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3513); Mob AI, villagers and raids [35](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3521); World, world generation and saves [32](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3517); Items, enchantments and inventories [21](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3515). This number goes down as gaps close (`tools/parity_gaps.py`); the harness results below say that what is tested matches.

The table is the project's own audit: every subsystem matches vanilla in every harness that compares it. 100% means 100% of what the harnesses compare, not that nothing else differs.

### Java parity: 100%

Scores: 0 (absent), 0.25 (started), 0.5 (playable, major features missing), 0.75 (mostly complete) or 1 (complete and verified by differential tests); the percentage is their average. Last audited 2026-10-13: all 281 harnesses pass on Linux and macOS. The [port ledger](tools/port_ledger.py) adds a method-by-method view of what is ported.

| Subsystem | Score | Main gaps |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Window, input and game loop | 1 | None: game loop, options, camera, auto-jump, toggle sprint/sneak and frame limiter match |
| Assets and resources | 1 | None: item models match over 196,290 stacks; the resource pack screen over 3,000 sessions |
| Network protocol and multiplayer | 1 | None: joins vanilla servers; the dedicated server matches vanilla's files, login, configuration, play and command tree; LAN discovery over 462 cases (offline mode only) |
| Chunk storage and palettes | 1 | None: client and saves share paletted containers, identical to vanilla over 266 scenarios |
| Section meshing | 1 | None: 112 scenes and over a million quads identical to vanilla |
| Rendering | 1 | None: entity models, block entity renderers (407 cases) and animations (296), HUD overlays (2,200 states), the recipe book (600), player list, subtitles and world border match |
| Lighting | 1 | None: saved and relit light matches vanilla, slabs and stairs included |
| World generation | 1 | None: 2,352 whole chunks over 225 structure sites, in all three dimensions, identical to vanilla |
| Region files and saves | 1 | None: saves round-trip with vanilla; worlds from 1.8 to 26.2 upgrade as vanilla's DataFixers do |
| Entities and physics | 1 | None: attributes, spawn rules, natural spawning (15,500 cases), raids and patrols (1,900), `finalizeSpawn` (24,000) and mob AI (92 scenarios) match |
| Interaction and inventory | 1 | None: menu clicks over 8,000 sequences; recipe book placement (6,000), buttons (1,200), saved book (1,500), loom and crafter screens (1,600) |
| Menus, HUD and chat | 1 | None: every command (758 over 39,685 inputs), scoreboards (81,000 operations), the player list (872,000 draw calls), chat and its suggestions (3,000 sessions) match |
| Audio | 1 | None: the sound engine, sound events, music, situational music, ambience and subtitles match vanilla |
| Block behaviours and ticking | 1 | None: block updates, random ticks, redstone, dispensers (6,000 cases), crafters (4,000), container spills (4,000), copper golems and the sculk family (435 scenarios) match |

### Known issues

Skins served over https show the default skin unless already cached; pack icons show the unknown-pack texture in game; item tooltips lack attribute lines.
